# AI Practicum: Trajectory Based Anomaly Detection

This project involves building an object detection pipeline using YOLO and other deep learning models, processing real-time video feeds or video clips for object detection, then using the trajectories of detected objects, to perform trajectory based anomaly detection.

Currently the plan is rule-based systems but as the project evolves, we are going to use machine learning techniques in supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo and navigate into the directory:


2. Set up the Python environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run object detection (example script coming soon).
